Windows Port Notes
==================

How to build (using mingw cross compiler, on a linux system):

  Follow instructions at http://live.gnome.org/GTK%2B/Win32/Apps
  with following changes.
  Make sure you download all in one bundle from following link.
  http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.12/

  1. Before doing 'sed -f ...' command
    a. Download gtksourceview(-dev) zip files from
       http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtksourceview/2.4/
       and extract them in mingw directory.
    b. Download libxml2 zip file from http://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml/
       and extract it in mingw directory.

  2. Before doing "./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc ..."
    a. Comment out Requires.private from gtksourceview-2.0.pc. This needs to
       be done to workaround problem in libxml2 distribution.
    b. Modify the configure script and delete any lines containing word
       '_nl_expand_alias'. This needs to be done to workaround a bug in autoconf
       macro for gettext detection.

  3. Use configure command as follows
     ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --prefix=/

How to build installer (using nsis, on a linux system):

  1. Make sure you have nsis installed.

  2. After doing "./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc ..."
    a. Execute command "makensis installer.nsi".
       This builds the application and then installer.

How to install:

  1. Install GTK+ runtime for windows available at
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-win/

  2. Using installer
    a. Just run the installer. :-)

  3. Without using installer
    a. Copy gnusim8085.exe and 8085asm.lang files to windows machine.
    b. Copy libgtksourceview-2.0-0.dll and libxml2.dll to same directory
       as gnusim8085.exe.
    c. Copy language2.rng, styles.rng and classic.xml file found in gtksourceview
       installation to same directory as gnusim8085.exe.

Status:

  gnusim8085.exe runs fine on Windows machine. :-)
