How to build and create installer using mingw cross compiler and nsis, on a
linux system

64 bit Fedora installation (default build using GTK3):
Pre-requisites:
1. Install packages mingw32-gtksourceview3, mingw32-nsis, discount
2. Install package meson when trying to build using meson.

Build using meson:
1. Use configure command as follows
   meson builddir --prefix=/ --cross-file meson_cross_win32.txt
2. Change to builddir and execute command "ninja". This builds the application.
3. Execute command "DESTDIR=`pwd`/win32 ninja install'.
   This installs application in a temporary folder to be used by installer build script.
4. Execute command "makensis installer.nsi".
   This builds the installer.

Build using autotools:
1. Use configure command as follows
   ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --prefix=/
2. Execute command "make". This builds the application.
3. Execute command "make DESTDIR=`pwd`/win32 install'.
   This installs application in a temporary folder to be used by installer build script.
4. Execute command "makensis installer.nsi".
   This builds the installer.

TODO:

  1. Create makefile for native Mingw installation.
