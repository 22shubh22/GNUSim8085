Windows Port Notes
==================

Status:

  Using MinGW and Windows ports of several Gtk+ and related libraries, I could
  create gnusim8085.exe and it runs flawlessly on Windows Vista.

Things to fix:

  0. [Nearfar] Make the 8085asm.lang work on Windows installation
  
  1. [Nearfar] interface.c: Write replacement for gnome_url_show_on_screen();
  
  2. [Nearfar] support.c: Write replacement for gnome_program_locate_file(); to
  make the ICON work.
