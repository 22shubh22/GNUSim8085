Windows Port Notes
==================

How to build (using mingw cross compiler, on a linux system):

  Follow instructions at http://live.gnome.org/GTK%2B/Win32/Apps
  with following changes.

  1. Before doing 'sed -f ...' command
    a. Download gtksourceview(-dev) zip files from
       http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtksourceview/2.2/
       and extract them in mingw directory.
    b. Download libxml2 zip file from http://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml/
       and extract it in mingw directory.

  2. Before doing "./configure --target=i586-mingw32msvc ..."
    a. Add target=win32 in gtksourceview-2.0.pc
    a. Comment out Requires.private from gtksourceview-2.0.pc. This needs to
       be done to workaround problem in libxml2 distribution.

How to install:

  1. Install GTK+ runtime for windows available at
     http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html
  2. Copy libgtksourceview-2.0-0.dll and libxml2.dll in same directory
     where other dll files are placed in to GTK+ runtime installation.
  3. Copy gnusim8085.exe and 8085.lang file to windows machine.

Status:

  gnusim8085.exe runs fine on Windows machine. :-)

TODO:

  0. [Onkar] Write a installer using NSIS.
  
  1. [Nearfar] interface.c: Write replacement for gnome_url_show_on_screen();
  
  2. [Nearfar] support.c: Write replacement for gnome_program_locate_file(); to
  make the ICON work.
